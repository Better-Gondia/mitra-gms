  "faq_q_process_new": "How do I process a new complaint?",
  "faq_q_process_new_ans": "**What:** This is your primary task. It involves reviewing new complaints and sending them to the right department.\n**Where:** New complaints appear on your main dashboard with an `Open` status.\n**How:**\n1. Click a complaint card to expand it and read the details.\n2. Click the `Open` status badge on the right.\n3. In the popover, choose `Assign`, select the correct department (e.g., 'Public Works'), and add a brief note.\n4. Click `Update Complaint`. The complaint will now move to that department's queue.",
  "faq_q_invalid_vs_details": "What's the difference between 'Invalid' and 'Need Details'?",
  "faq_q_invalid_vs_details_ans": "**'Invalid':** Use this when a complaint is spam, a duplicate, or outside the administration's jurisdiction. It closes the complaint immediately.\n\n**'Need Details':** Use this when you need more specific information from the citizen (e.g., 'Please provide the exact location of the pothole'). The complaint stays in your queue while you wait for their response.",
  "faq_q_find_old": "How do I find a complaint I worked on before?",
  "faq_q_find_old_ans": "**What:** Find past complaints.\n**Where:** Use the search bar at the top or the advanced filter toggles.\n**How:** Press `/` to focus the search bar and type an ID or keyword. You can also click the filter icons for `My Remarks` or `Mentions` to see only complaints you've interacted with.",
  "faq_q_see_dept_complaints": "Where do I see complaints for my department?",
  "faq_q_see_dept_complaints_ans": "When you log in with the `Department Team` role, the dashboard automatically shows you all complaints `Assigned` to your department, as well as those `In Progress` or in your `Backlog`.",
  "faq_q_resolve_complaint": "How do I resolve a complaint?",
  "faq_q_resolve_complaint_ans": "**What:** The final step to close a complaint after the work is done.\n**Where:** From the complaint card, click the status badge (e.g., `In Progress`).\n**How:**\n1. In the popover, select the `Resolved` status.\n2. Add a final remark explaining what was done (e.g., 'The pothole has been filled and the road is now clear').\n3. **Crucially, click `Attach Media`** to upload photo proof of the completed work. This is vital for transparency and records.\n4. Click `Update Complaint`.",
  "faq_q_what_is_backlog": "What is the 'Backlog' status for?",
  "faq_q_what_is_backlog_ans": "Use `Backlog` for complaints that are valid but can't be addressed immediately (e.g., waiting for budget approval, parts to arrive, or another department's work to finish). It keeps the complaint in your queue but signals that it's not actively being worked on.",
  "faq_q_get_overview": "How can I get a quick overview of everything?",
  "faq_q_get_overview_ans": "As the District Collector, your dashboard has two views. The `Analytics` view (default) shows high-level charts. The `List` view shows all individual complaints. The KPI cards at the top provide an at-a-glance statistical summary. Click any KPI card to filter the list.",
  "faq_q_flag_urgent": "How do I flag a complaint for urgent attention?",
  "faq_q_flag_urgent_ans": "**What:** Add a high-visibility remark to escalate an issue.\n**Where:** In the action popover for any complaint.\n**How:** Click the status badge, and simply type your instruction in the `Remark` box (e.g., 'CMO to submit a report on this within 24 hours'). Remarks from your role are automatically highlighted in yellow in the timeline, ensuring they are seen and acted upon.",
  "faq_q_what_is_attention_score": "What is the 'Attention Score' (🔥)?",
  "faq_q_what_is_attention_score_ans": "**What:** An AI-calculated number from 1-100 showing the *true, current urgency* of a complaint.\n**Why:** It's smarter than a simple 'High' priority flag. It analyzes keywords (like 'danger' or 'hospital'), how long the complaint has been waiting, how many times it's been updated, and if a high-level stakeholder like you has commented on it.\n**How:** Your list is sorted by this score by default, so the most critical issues automatically float to the top. You can also click the `Calculate Scores` button to have the AI re-evaluate all active complaints.",
  "faq_q_what_can_stakeholders_do": "What can I do on this platform?",
  "faq_q_what_can_stakeholders_do_ans": "As a key stakeholder (MP, MLA, etc.), you have read-only access to all complaints. While you cannot change a complaint's status, your primary tool is the **Official Remark**. By adding a remark to any complaint, you can highlight critical issues for the administration's attention. Your remarks are given high visibility (highlighted in yellow) to ensure they are addressed promptly, effectively allowing you to escalate any complaint in the system.",
